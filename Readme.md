### About
In Ko Phagnan right now, it's 5.16AM and I just wrapped up a 4h code sesh. 
Smoked a nice THC pre-rolled joint with 50% weed and 50% leaf - first time!

Got inspired to create this shortcut tool while working on RAG & AI System Messages for a another personal project.

### Instructions
Set this project to run on boot, with npm start

Then simply: 
CMD+D opens a 1 liner that enables you to run commands that copy a template to clipboard.


### features
- search has autocomplete for available template names and their args
- tab to fill in the auto complete
- tab tice to clear
- templates can be grouped by category (e.g. comments.comment_top hello world)

### next steps
- Can have another shortcut to copy text following structued context that's been enforced by an LLM, with a UI/UX element (e.g. spinner) during any processing time.
- For the above, add a sound on copy done
